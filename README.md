## Learnify

A simple course management application built with Angular version 15.

### Features

* Reads courses from a JSON file and displays them to the user.
* Allows users to add and edit courses.
* Provides a course detail component for viewing course information.
* Uses Angular Material and FormBuilder for UI and data manipulation.
* Added Tailwind but did not use it because I don't like it.
